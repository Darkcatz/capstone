                        <ul>
                            <li>Talk to people when the time is right so that you will both be calm and acknowledge each other' s opinions.   This will also help to not cause a fight between two people to do to them being able to think through what they have done.   If it not spoken at the right time it can cause you to make a false assumption.</li>
                            <li>Talk face to face due to writing can be easily misinterpreted over serious matters.  This will allow you to make sure you can effectively communicate together and be able to understand each other's emotions.</li>
                            <li>Do not attack the other person when they are speaking to you so that you can be able to resolve the situation.   This will cause your partner to be defensive and not listen to what you have to say. </li>
                            <li>Telling truth can help to improve your relationship by building trust in your partner.  Do to no person ever being perfect so it is okay to make a mistake in life.</li>
                            <li>Try to take a break before trying to resolve conflict so that you do not do something that you do not want to do.  Preventing you from making rash decisions that are not who you truly are.   After some time and you still feel that way then it is time to talk to that person about it. </li>
