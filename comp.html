                        <p>
                            Values are the degree of importance of something that you do.

                        <p>
                            They are important because it is what you think is more valuable than another thing and it will help you have better or worse ethics.

                            You can first list from the most important to least important things that you do. Then you can ask yourself questions if you are valuing the right thing.

                        <p>
                            People bully others because of their own insecurities and stress and they want to take it out on another weaker individual.

                        <p><strong><i>What is bullying?</i></strong></p>
                        <p>Bullying is when a person is harming another person physically or psychologically.</p>
                        <p><strong><i>Who plays a role in it?</i></strong></p>
                        <p>In bullying, the bystanders play a big role. This is because that they are not doing anything and it shows the victim that no one cares about him or her.</p>
                        <p><strong><i>How do we stop it?</i></strong></p>
                        <p>The way to stop bullying is to show the bully that what he is doing is not ok. We should not use physical measures but to tell an adult or not be bystanders.</p>

                            Compassion is very important because it shows a person that you care about them and this can help them a lot in life.
